# PDF_Generator
This is a program to generate pdf using images saved in a directory. I have programmed it to take .png images but it can be changed easily.
First select the directory where all the phots are saved. Then enter the pdf filename with .pdf extension
Now hit run button.

Please include fpdf in you python lib. Path : vnev/Lib/site-packages.
